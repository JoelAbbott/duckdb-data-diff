"""
TDD Test Suite for Dynamic Report Filtering Fix.

This test MUST FAIL until dynamic filtering logic is implemented in export_differences.
The test verifies that the value_differences.csv report only includes:
1. Key columns (always included)
2. Value columns that actually have differences (Status != 'Matched')
