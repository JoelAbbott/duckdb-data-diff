# Additional Value Coercion Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Date Format: "1/20/2025" vs "1/20/2025 0:00" 
**Status**: FIXED
- Added pattern `'%m/%d/%Y %H:%M'` to date parsing
- Now correctly recognizes dates with time component
- **Important**: Only dates with same time are equal (e.g., both midnight)
- Your specific example works: "1/20/2025" = "1/20/2025 0:00" (both are midnight)

### 2. ✅ Currency with Spaces: "-€ 30,848.00" vs "-30848.0"
**Status**: FIXED
- Updated currency regex from `'[$£€¥₪₹¢]'` to `'\\s*[$£€¥₪₹¢]\\s*'`
- Handles spaces before/after currency symbols
- Added TRIM to clean up any remaining spaces
- Your example now works correctly

### 3. ❌ HTML Entities: ">" vs "&gt;"
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED (by design)
- Too risky for automatic handling
- Could corrupt legitimate data containing "&gt;" string
- Should be handled during data import/staging if needed

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/core/comparator.py` - Updated `_build_robust_comparison_condition()` method

### Changes Made

1. **Date Pattern Addition** (lines 668, 681):
   ```python
   TRY_STRPTIME(TRY_CAST(column AS VARCHAR), '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M')
   ```

2. **Currency Regex Improvement** (lines 634, 654):
   ```python
   # From: '[$£€¥₪₹¢]'
   # To:   '\\s*[$£€¥₪₹¢]\\s*'
   # Plus added TRIM() wrapper
   ```

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/unit/test_additional_coercion_fixes.py`:
- ✅ All 4 tests passing
- Tests specific reported cases
- Tests regression on existing formats
- Tests currency with various spacing patterns

## Important Notes

### Date Comparison Behavior
- "1/20/2025" vs "1/20/2025 0:00" → **EQUAL** (both midnight)
- "1/20/2025" vs "1/20/2025 9:30" → **DIFFERENT** (midnight vs 9:30 AM)

This is the correct behavior. If you need all dates on the same day to be equal regardless of time, that would require a different approach (truncating to date only).

### Currency Handling
The improved regex now handles:
- Spaces before currency: "  $100"
- Spaces after currency: "$  100" 
- Spaces around currency: "- € 100"
- Multiple spaces: "$   100"

## Verification

All tests pass:
- `test_value_coercion.py` - 8/8 tests pass
- `test_additional_coercion_fixes.py` - 4/4 tests pass

No regression in existing functionality.
